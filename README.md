## Investigate a Dataset

# Udacity Data Analysis Project: Movie Data Exploration

### Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my coursework in the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program. The objective was to analyze a complex dataset of movies, cleaning and transforming the data to answer specific exploratory questions. This included investigating trends in genre popularity, analyzing factors contributing to high-revenue movies, and understanding the impact of properties such as runtime and popularity.

### Dataset
The dataset includes various attributes of movies such as:

* Popularity, budget, revenue
* Runtime, genres, vote counts, vote averages
* Directors and release years

### Key Questions Explored
* Which movie genres are most popular over time?
* What characteristics are associated with high-revenue movies?
* Does movie runtime correlate with revenue or popularity?

### Project Highlights
Throughout this project, I focused on data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization to reveal meaningful insights. Some of the highlights include:

* Identifying directors with the most high-revenue movies
* Exploring genre popularity by year
* Investigating runtime, budget, and other factors in relation to revenue and popularity

### Feedback Summary
I received positive feedback on my work from Udacity reviewers:

* Coding Quality: Functional, error-free code with effective data wrangling.
* Data Cleaning and Manipulation: Thorough approach to handling and preparing data.
* Analysis and Visualizations: Clear and varied visualizations to support findings.

I was also encouraged to continue exploring data science concepts and techniques, including probability-based analysis for clearer insights.

### Future Work
Based on the feedback, I plan to:

* Modularize the code for easier future use
* Explore probabilistic analysis to deepen the insights
* Investigate additional correlations and conduct more advanced visualizations

### Conclusion
This project was a valuable experience in data analysis, enhancing my skills in data manipulation, cleaning, and visualization. Completing this project has given me confidence in applying my skills to real-world datasets and preparing for more complex data science challenges ahead.
